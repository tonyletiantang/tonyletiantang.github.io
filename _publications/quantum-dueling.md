title: "Quantum dueling: an efficient solution for combinatorial optimization"
collection: publications
category: articles
excerpt: 'An independent project where I discovered an efficient optimization algorithm based on the Grover operator. I recruited five fellow undergrads and trained them to start work. We demonstrated a strong performance of the algorithm via numerical simulations and justifications for its success.'
