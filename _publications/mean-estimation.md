title: "More-efficient Quantum Multivariate Mean Value Estimator from Generalized Grover Operator"
collection: publications
category: articles
excerpt: 'By combining existing ideas with novel techniques, I constructed the fastest multivariate mean value estimation. algorithm. For $d$ dimension and $\delta$ success probability, the algorithm runs in only $$\log(d/\delta))/\log(1/\delta))$$ slower than the known lower bound. '
