I am Tony (Letian) Tang (汤乐天), an undergraduate student at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing a dual degree in Physics and Computer Science. I am interested in quantum information in the interdisciplinary areas of field theory, quantum algorithms, and condensed matter physics. I wish to build efficient quantum algorithms inspired by mathematical structures in theoretical physics, and understand information dynamics in quantum matter and black holes.
